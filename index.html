					<h1>life is a journey to the graveyard</h1>
					<p>
						"Life is a journey to the graveyard" every step we are making we are moving close to it but the greatness of creation is destination address not always conscious to us, In this journey of life starting point is not decided by us and we don't have clarity on the ending point.
so profoundness of life lies in its journey I WISH YOUR JOURNEY EXPERIENCE WILL GLOW WITH YOUR GREATEST MATURITY AND WITH YOUR GRACIOUSNESS.
